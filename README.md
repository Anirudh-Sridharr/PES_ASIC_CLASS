 " ASIC design coursework repository "
## Course Objectives: 
The objective of the course is to convert a logical RTL design into a physical layout suitable for fabrication. This process ensures the circuit's functionality aligns with design constraints, performance goals, and manufacturing standards.

## outcomes: 
To be able to understand the functioning and design of ASICs, Being able to define RTLs for a circuit's behaviour, layout floor planning, clock tree synthesis for synchronous circuits, Placement and routing.

## Setup and installation
