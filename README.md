# PES_ASIC_CLASS
 " ASIC design coursework repository "
## Course Objectives: 
The objective of the course is to convert a logical RTL design into a physical layout suitable for fabrication. This process ensures the circuit's functionality aligns with design constraints, performance goals, and manufacturing standards.

## outcomes: 
To be able to understand the functioning and design of ASICs, Being able to define RTLs for a circuit's behaviour, layout floor planning, clock tree synthesis for synchronous circuits, Placement and routing.

## Setup and installation:

1. Download the `run.sh` script from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kunalg123/riscv_workshop_collaterals/blob/master/run.sh).

2. Open a terminal on your system.

3. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the `run.sh` script.

4. Execute the script by running the following command:

    ```sh
    ./run.sh
    ```

This will initiate the installation process and set up the necessary environment for the course.

# DAY 1
  
## Introduction to RISC-V ISA and GNU Compiler Toolchain

### Introduction to Basic Keywords
- Introduction:
  A system has an assembly language, RISC-V in our case which is at the level of hexadecimal numbers. This further gets converted   to binary which goes down into the chip layout through RTL and HDL.  
- From Apps to Hardware: 
  All the way, A C or C++ code gets complied into an assembly language of the RISC-V architecture which further gets assembled  into binary which is understood by a processor to
